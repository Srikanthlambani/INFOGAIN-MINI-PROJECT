# INFOGAIN-MINI-PROJECT
The project we have done in our engineering third year second semester 2022.

We created a GUI tool in which it takes website url as input.

It provides output of the following:

## DNS INFO
## SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION
## OPEN PORT LIST
## DIRECTORY BRUTEFORCE
## WHOIS LOOKUP

We used python programming language for our project.

Tkinter module for gui

beautiful soup for whois information scrapping from website.

we did bruteforcing for subdomain enumeration and directorybrute forcing.

Dns module for openport and dns lookup.
