->What is in a Whois record?
 -Whois is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain 
  and how to get in contact with them. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
  Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain name registration and ownership. Whois records have 
  proven to be extremely useful and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining 
  the integrity of the domain name registration and website ownership process.
 -A Whois record contains all of the contact information associated with the person, 
  group, or company that registers a particular domain name. Typically, each Whois record 
  will contain information such as the name and contact information of the Registrant 
  (who owns the domain), the name and contact information of the registrar Registrar 
  (the organization or commercial entity that registered the domain name), 
  the registration dates, the name servers, the most recent update, and the expiration date. 
  Whois records may also provide the administrative and technical contact information 
  (which is often, but not always, the registrant).
