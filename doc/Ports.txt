->What is a port?
  -A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. 
   Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. 
   Each port is associated with a specific process or service. 
   Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: 
   emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both 
   reach a computer over the same Internet connection.


->What is a port number?
  -Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, 
   with each port assigned a number. Most ports are reserved for certain protocols — 
   for example, all Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages go to port 80. 
   While IP addresses enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers 
   allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices.

->How do ports make network connections more efficient?
  -Vastly different types of data flow to and from a computer over the same network 
   connection. The use of ports helps computers understand what to do with the data they receive.

->Why should we focus more on open ports.
  -Open ports become dangerous when legitimate services are exploited through security vulnerabilities 
   or malicious services are introduced to a system via malware or social engineering, 
   cybercriminals can use these services in conjunction with open ports to gain unauthorized access to 
   sensitive data.  
  -Closing unused ports reduces your security risk by reducing the number of attack vectors your 
   organization is exposed to.
