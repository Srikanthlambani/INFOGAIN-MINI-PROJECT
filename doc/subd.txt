->What is Subdomain
  -A subdomain is an additional part to your main domain name. 
  -Subdomains are created to organize and navigate to different sections of your website. 
  -You can create multiple subdomains or child domains on your main domain.
  -A subdomain is an appendix to your main website domain, like subdomain.example.com. 
  -It helps to organize website structure. Companies mostly use it for such goals:
  -As testing environments before implementing changes to the main website. Like beta.example.com
  -To deploy projects with a technology that differs from one in the main domain. 
   For example, it could be a fan shop for a football team website. E-commerce engines usually differ 
   from content websites, so developers need an isolated environment to set it up.
  -To host a local email server like email1.example.com
  -Use subdomain for mobile versions or location-specific versions of the website. Like m.facebook.com or uk.example.com
  -To create a special project with a unique name to emphasize its importance. Like blackfriday.example.com

->Use Cases of Subdomain
  -The most common use-case of a subdomain is for creating a testing or staging version of a website. 
   Often developers will test new plugins and updates on a subdomain staging site before publishing 
   them live on the Internet.
  -Another common use of a subdomain is to create an online eCommerce store. 
   Often companies want a separate subdomain to handle transactions because eCommerce sites typically 
   require a more complex set up.
  -We have also seen companies use subdomains for their mobile websites (m.yoursite.com), 
   location-specific sites (uk.yoursite.com), and creating sub-sections of the website.
  -You can install WordPress on your subdomain, and it will work as a separate installation from your main website.
   You can use a subdomain to serve a specific group of users on your site like ‘guest.yourwebsite.com’, 
   ‘user.yourwebsite.com’, and more. This is how website builder platforms like WordPress.com, blogger.com, 
   and others offer custom websites to users.
  -Subdomains can be very useful in organizing your website content more efficiently. 
   The right use of a subdomain does not affect your main website’s SEO. However, when in doubt, 
   we recommend keeping everything on the same domain and avoid using a subdomain for public sites.


->how finding subdomains can be used in business reconnaissance by your competitor:
  -Find subdomains for testing and see what changes a company is going to make. 
  -Competitors can use it to outstrip one or prepare anticipatory moves.
  -List technologies a company uses. Knowing weak and strong sides rivals can use it to build a 
   more competitive technological stack. That also really helps in industrial espionage.
  -Find out about special projects before their launch and announcement. 
   Again, to make anticipatory moves or spoil it.
  -Hack email server to read internal correspondence and send letters to employees. 
   For example, Rojan Rijal described how he was able to intercept emails for Uber.
  -Get access to sensitive data and files which are situated on a subdomain.

->What Hackers can do if he/she gets  control over Subdomains
  -Deface a website page and hurt a company’s reputation
  -Steal user data
  -Create a “phishing” page on a credible subdomain
  -Put a redirect to a malicious website
  -Blackmail a company to get paid
  -Steal the source code of a website
  -Modify cookie of the main website
   If subdomain.example.com has the authority to modify cookies on the main website, 
   perpetrators can set up malicious cookies. This opens ways to steal user data, 
   analyze their activity or impersonate user sessions.

->How to Protect our subdomains
  -Set up proper firewalls for all subdomains for internal use.
  -Secure your subdomain name access credentials, 
   update your password every 90 days, and log who has access to it.
  -Thoroughly and constantly update a list of subdomains in use.
  -Keep a log of all 3rd party services used and their subdomains. 
   Here is a wonderful list of 62 third-party services that can be exposed to subdomain takeover.
  -Instantly close subdomains you don’t use. The smaller the attack surface – the better. 
   Don't forget to update DNS configurations for subdomains you need, but they currently are not in use.
  -Establish a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the “life” of your subdomains, 
   so your team will know when you close the subdomain. Start provisioning by claiming the virtual host; 
   create DNS records last. Start deprovisioning by removing DNS records first.
  -Thoroughly choose hosting vendors, study how they verify a person who is claiming a virtual host. 
   Develop a standard vendor qualification process.
  -Use uncommon names for subdomains. It makes brute-forcing hard – dictionaries don’t have words 
   like aptoplasure12334fx.example.com.
  -Use honeypots for active defense. It’s a method of active defense intelligence where you at purpose 
   create hosts that are attractive to potential attackers but place non-critical machines in a network that 
   are isolated from the company's production environment. If there is an attack, cybersecurity specialists 
   can gather information about the attackers and use it to reinforce the defense. 
  -Periodically run a checkup for your website on Spyse to see its security score, 
   possible CVE, and what public information about your website structure and subdomains is available.
  -Write strict guidelines on subdomain usage, share it with your team, and control the execution. 
   It’s good to print these rules and hang them on the wall in the IT department.
